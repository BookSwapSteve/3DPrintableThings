# 80mm Gasket for fan to ducting connection

This gasket (if that's even the right name for it) is designed to fit holes for 80mm fans.

It is intended to go between a hole in 100mm Manrose ducting and an outer component (such as an 80mm fan, or fan adaptor, or blank), this allows the gasket to be screwed to the ducting and have 4x M4 mounting machine screws pointing outwards for a second component to be fitted to, making mounting easier (i.e. no struggling to get your hand in the duct to fit nuts to the back of bolts - the opening in the duct when fitting
this makes it easy - you could use self tappers but these are not good for repeated operations).

It's main use is intended for connecting an angled pipe with a fan on allowing it to be fixed easily to the duct and rotated, where normally some mounting holes might not be easily accessible and repeated use of self tappers might damage the ducting.

It can also form the backing for a blank to be placed over the duct vent hole, or just as a handy drilling / hole marker.

Features:

* 4x Inward facing M4 countersunk screw holes to fit hole pattern of a 80mm fan.
* 4x Outward facing M4 countersunk screw holes to fit hole pattern of a 80mm fan.
* 8x recesses for small magnets (up to 6mm in diameter to be inserted, 2-3mm deep), allowing for a quick change duct connector (Note: these are untested)

Note: You might wish to add some glue to the outward facing machine screws to prevent the bolt rotating when tighten the nut as the screw head won't be accessible.
