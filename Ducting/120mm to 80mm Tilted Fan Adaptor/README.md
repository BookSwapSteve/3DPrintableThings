# 120MM TO 80MM Tilted Fan Adaptor

Design to mount a 120mm fan at a tilted angle and rotatable on the base, for connection to 100mm flat ducting (ideally via the gasket)[https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4170152]

This allows a 120mm fan to be angled towards the work area for better extraction / fitting.
