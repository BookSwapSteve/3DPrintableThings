# Wall Mounting Enclosure for Kindle Fire 8 HD

Enclosure is split into two for easier printing and to allow the Kindle Fire to be fitted once mounted on the wall!

Can be either Landscape with the Kindle Fire slid in from the side, or portrait with the Fire dropped in from above.

Print with flat edges on the bed (-Top will need to be rotated).

## Sizes:

* Normal - 240mm wide. About as small as it can be whilst allowing for top/bottom joining pins.
* Large - 268mm wide. Just about hides the USB plug. About as wide as it's possible to print on the Ultimaker 2+

## Variables:

* boxWidth - how wide the enclosure is. 240-268mm suggeted range.

* displayXOverlap and displayYOverlap - how much overlap the front bezel is on the display. 
** 20 & 9 are about the max before the actual display area is effected.
** min about 1-2mm each.

* backboxStyle - the style of opening at the back. 
** 1=80x80 for UK back box
** 2=Small USB B Plug sized hole
