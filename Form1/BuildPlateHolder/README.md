# Form 1 Build Plate Holder.

Build plate holder for the Form 1 printer to help during print removal.

The supplied accessory kit for the Form 1 is not great to hold the plate steady when you are trying to remove the parts after printing. This holder can be screwed to the work bench for added stability.

Simple to use:

* Attach to work surface or a bit of MDF to help hold it securly
* Slide your build plate in at an angle
* Remove parts from your build plate as you would normally.
